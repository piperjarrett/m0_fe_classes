# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  I had to take a second to figure out where exactly to start without direct instruction. After that just by poking at the code helped me figure out how to make it correct.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  My workflow is working really well for me. As long as I take my lunch break and little breaks after I have been working on a code for more than an hour and a hlaf, my productivity stays high.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

  I just need to remember to take breaks and clear my head when I am stuck on a code. Also meeting with someone over zoom can be beneficial when I don't know what to do because it is a fresh set of eyes on the code. Also focusing on the syntax will help me be successful and not spend to much time trying to figure out why my code doesn't work.
